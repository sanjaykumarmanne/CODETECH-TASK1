 ### Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple command-line based calculator application in Java. This calculator will take two numbers as input from the user, allow the user to select a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), perform the chosen operation, and then display the result to the user. This project will help reinforce basic Java programming concepts such as user input handling, control structures, and basic arithmetic operations.

### Objectives

1. User Input Handling: Learn how to capture and validate user input using the Scanner class in Java.
2. Arithmetic Operations: Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
3. Control Structures: Use conditional statements to determine which operation to perform based on user input.
4. Error Handling: Handle potential errors such as division by zero and invalid input.
5. Output Results: Display the result of the chosen operation to the user in a clear and user-friendly manner.

### Key Activities

1. Setup Project Environment
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if not already installed.
   - Set up a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or use a text editor and command line.

2. Design Program Structure
   - Plan the main structure of the program, including the methods needed for input handling, performing calculations, and displaying results.

3. Implement User Input Handling
   - Use the Scanner class to read input from the user.
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
   - Prompt the user to choose an operation.

4. Implement Arithmetic Operations
   - Create methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Ensure division handles division by zero appropriately.

5. Control Flow for Operations
   - Use conditional statements (e.g., if-else or switch) to execute the appropriate arithmetic operation based on user input.

6. Error Handling
   - Implement error handling to manage invalid inputs and exceptional cases like division by zero.
   - Provide user-friendly error messages.

7. Display Results
   - Output the result of the calculation to the user.
   - Format the output for readability.

8. Testing and Debugging
   - Test the program with various inputs to ensure all operations work correctly.
   - Debug any issues that arise during testing.

9. Code Documentation
   - Add comments to the code to explain the logic and flow.
   - Ensure the code is clean and well-documented

Summary

This project is a great way to practice and apply basic Java programming skills. By completing this project, you will gain experience in handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, managing control flow, and handling errors. This fundamental project lays the groundwork for more complex programming challenges.
